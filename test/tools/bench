#   bench - invoke configuration specific benchmarking commands
#
#   Different users may want to benchmark different setups. Users can control
#   the benchmarked setup by writing shell functions in a configuration file.

#   ect...), what server to contact and so on.
#   The bench tool load the configuration file and invoke the appropriate
#   functions during the benchmark executions.
