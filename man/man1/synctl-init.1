.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Create an empty Synctl repository \- basically a directory where Synctl can
store created snapshots\&.
.sp
Synctl can only create repositories locally (i.e. on the local computer)\&.
However, a repository is accessible either locally or remotely through ssh,
assumed that there is an ssh daemon up and running\&.
.sp
Running \fIsynctl init\fR giving it an existing directory will fail without
overwriting anything. This behavior can be overriden with the \-\-force
option\&.
